# Blog website using Node JS + MongoDB + Exspress

Firstly, I did assignment on Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree program. Task was simple. Just make static blog website (main and blog page). Before starting this assignment I designed this website UI using Figma



Then, I made simple HTML + CSS static page from design. So, I decided to complete this project with dynamic data.

I used NodeJS for backend and Mongodb for database. I improve this project step by step in near future.
