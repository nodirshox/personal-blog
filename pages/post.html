                    Iceland is famous for many things: Geothermal energy, glaciers, volcanoes, ponies, large men with beards, being greener than Greenland, and of course <strong>WATERFALLS</strong>. These waterfalls or foss in Icelandic are some of the most stunning I've ever seen. Within the <u>40,000</u> square miles of Iceland there are over 10,000 waterfalls--that's one every 4 miles! And these aren't the pipsqueak waterfalls you occasionally pass while driving (aka rain run-off or snow melt), these babies are big, powerful and beautiful.

                <p>
                    The best way to view a large number of waterfalls if you are staying in <em>Iceland</em> is to use the Ring Road, as most of the big ones fall in its path.

                <h2>Öxarárfoss -  Öxará River</h2>
                <p>Starting out small. This waterfall is part of the <i>Pingvellir National Park</i> which sits directly on the fault line between <b>Eurasia</b> and <b>North American</b> tectonic plates.</p>
                <h2>Seljalandsfoss & Gljúfrafoss</h2>
                <p>These two falls were by far my favorite in Iceland! Heads up, for both of these waterfalls you WILL get wet. Both get their water from the massive volcanic glacier that rises above them called Eyjafjallajökull.</p>
